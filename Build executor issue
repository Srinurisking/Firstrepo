steps to tackle the build executor error:

/tmp have less storage in order to tackle the storage issue

we have to create a temp file in home directory like below

sudo mkdir /home/mytmp

next give permissions same like /tmp which is chmod 1777

sudo chmod 1777 /home/mytmp

Now attach this mytmp to the /tmp so whenever the tmp required space it will take from the home directory or root

sudo mount --bind /home/mytmp /tmp

Optional : make the change permanent so it will survive even system got reboots

sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add this line at the bottom 

/home/mytmp /tmp none bind 0 0 and save and exit ctrl+X and enter
